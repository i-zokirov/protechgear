### User email verification plan:

-   User model should have a verified attribute that is false by default
-   When the user submits a valid signup form, a new User record is created (who's verified attribute will be false initially)
-   Create a long random string (128 characters) with a crypto library and store it in the database Google Datastore in this case with a reference to the User record in MongoDB by id reference. Because good enough to store temporary values :P
-   Send an email to the supplied email address (Using Gmail API because it is free :P) with the hash as part of a link pointing back to a route on the application server
-   When the user clicks the link and hits the route, check for the hash passed in the URL, ensure the hashed token is not expired when clicked on.
-   If all statements above are positive, get the related user record from MongoDB and set the verified property to true
-   Delete the hash from the Datastore, it is no longer needed
-   User email is now verified
